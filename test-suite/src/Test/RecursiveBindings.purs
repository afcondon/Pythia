-- | Recursive LOCAL bindings, across the shapes that take different codegen
-- | paths.
-- |
-- | Added 2026-07-30 after `Data.Map` turned out to be unusable on the Python
-- | backend. The corpus already had `Test.Recursion`, and it passed — because
-- | every recursion in it is either top-level (a module-global name, late-bound
-- | in every target) or tail-recursive (eliminated by the TCO transform before
-- | codegen sees it). Neither exercises the path that breaks.
-- |
-- | The distinction that matters is not "does it recurse" but "how does the
-- | self-reference reach the body":
-- |
-- |   * free variable in an inline closure  -> late-bound, fine everywhere
-- |   * explicit captured argument after
-- |     the body is lambda-lifted           -> must be bound BEFORE the
-- |                                            right-hand side is evaluated
-- |
-- | A container fold is the ordinary way to land in the second case, which is
-- | why `Data.Map.Internal.foldrWithIndex` found it and nothing here did.
