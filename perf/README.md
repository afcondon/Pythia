# The performance canary

The differential suite answers *does this mean the same thing on both
runtimes?* This lane answers the other half: *and does it still cost what it
cost yesterday?*

```bash
cd perf
python3 run_perf.py                    # build, run, check
python3 run_perf.py --skip-build --echo # re-run, streaming
python3 run_perf.py --update-baseline   # re-record (say why in the commit)
```

## What it is for

Until now nothing in this repo would have noticed a code-generator change
that made a common shape ten times slower. The type-nesting finding of
2026-08-01 — a 1,000-iteration `Effect` loop taking 14 seconds — was found by
accident, while writing a test for something else. That is not a process.

The question the lane asks is **"has this backend drifted against itself?"**
Cross-runtime numbers fall out of the table and are printed, but they are not
the claim and should not become the framing. The shapes are chosen to be
*attributable*, not to be representative of real programs, so "Julia is
faster than JavaScript at X" is not a conclusion this lane supports.

## Two axes

The shapes cover both halves of what "performance of PureScript on this
runtime" means:

- **common computational patterns** — counted loops four ways, folds over a
  list and over an array, `map`, string building, record update
- **cost of the FFI seam** — `ffi-call` is `loop-fore` with the increment
  moved to the far side of the boundary, so their difference is the per-call
  crossing cost; `ffi-array` crosses once with n elements, so it measures
  marshalling instead

## Three design decisions worth knowing

**Timing lives in PureScript** (`Bench.Main`), not in the runner. Every
backend therefore executes byte-identical measurement code. A per-backend
harness written in the host language is the obvious alternative and it is
worse: it drifts, and the drift is invisible because it presents as a
performance difference.

**First call and steady state are reported separately.** Conflating them is
what made Jurist's first performance number uninterpretable — "170 ms per
iteration" was 99% compilation. Sizes for a shape run in ascending order
within one process and the first call at each size is timed on its own. That
first call is not a warm-up artefact to be discarded; on Julia a size that
demands types no smaller size demanded compiles again, so *first-call cost
growing with n* is the type-nesting signal itself.

**The baseline stores ratios, not milliseconds.** An absolute baseline is
worthless the moment it leaves the machine that recorded it. Each shape is
normalised, within its own backend and its own run, against `loop-fore` at
n=10000:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `rel` | steady(shape) / steady(calibration) — cost relative to a plain host loop on the same runtime |
| `f/s` | first / steady — how much of the first call is compilation |

Machine speed cancels, so the baseline is portable to CI. `f/s` is the
type-nesting signal in one number: ~1 on a runtime that does not compile per
call site, and large — and *staying* large as n grows — exactly where
specialisation is happening.

## Checksums gate; timings report

Every shape returns an `Int` checksum, and the runner diffs checksums across
backends **before it looks at a single timing**. A benchmark that computes
the wrong answer quickly is the classic way for a performance suite to stay
green while the thing it measures rots.

## Drift gates too, but only on rows that can carry a gate

Timing drift is a failure as well (`--gate-drift`, on in `bin/conformance.sh`).
It was not, when the lane was first built, and what changed is worth stating
precisely, because it is not what it looks like.

**The tolerance did not change.** It is still 2×. What changed is the
population it applies to, and the size of the thing everything is divided by.

The original calibration was `loop-fore` at n=1000, which at five reps is six
thousand iterations — not enough work for a tiering JIT to finish tiering.
The JS reference measured that shape at 114, 135, 167, 188 and 196 µs on the
same idle machine on the same day. Every `rel` in the table is divided by that
number, so the lane's noise floor was being set by its own denominator. The
tell was visible in the baseline and went unread: `loop-fore@10000` recorded
`rel` 10.4 on Jurist — linear in n, as a host loop should be — but 6.3 on JS,
not because the JS loop is sublinear but because its denominator was slow.
At n=10000 the calibration reads 1020/1027/1023 µs across runs.

That fixed the denominator but not the tail. Six back-to-back runs of all
three backends (2026-08-01, idle M4 MBP) put the worst run-to-run spread at:

| population | rows | median | 90th | worst |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| every measured row | 258 | 1.13× | 1.35× | **5.74×** |
| largest n of each shape | 78 | 1.10× | 1.26× | 1.69× |
| steady ≥ 50 µs | 123 | 1.10× | 1.27× | 5.74× |
| **both — the gated population** | 56 | 1.10× | 1.21× | **1.69×** |

A 2× gate over the first row would have fired on noise nearly every run. Over
the last it has 1.18× of headroom over the worst thing noise managed in six
tries. So the runner marks a row **gated** when it is both:

1. **the largest n of that shape** — the smaller sizes exist to show the
   *curve*, superlinearity and `f/s` growth, which is a diagnostic and not a
   threshold; and
2. **above `GATE_MIN_STEADY_US`** (50 µs) — below that, scheduler noise and
   timer resolution dominate. `ffi-array@1600` on the JS reference is ~20 µs
   and swings 1.5× between runs while doing identical work.

Ungated rows are still measured, still printed, and still reported as drift —
they just carry `(report only)` and cannot fail a build. Nothing is hidden.

The gate flag is decided when the baseline is **recorded**, and travels in it.
Recomputing it per run would make a shape near the 50 µs line gate on one run
and not the next. It is therefore a property of the recording machine: on a
slower box this excludes rows that would have been measurable there, which
costs a little coverage and never invents an alarm.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- `fold-array` is never gated on any backend, by design. It is `fold-list`'s
  control rather than a subject, and array traversal is gated through
  `map-array` instead.
- `ffi-array` and `string-join` run to n=12800 for no reason other than this.
  At 1600 both sat under the floor on every backend, so neither was gated
  anywhere — and `ffi-array` is one of the two shapes that measure the FFI
  axis this corpus was built around. **A shape that cannot fail the gate is
  not protected by it.**

Tighten toward the 90th percentile once a few weeks of CI runs say what the
tail really looks like; six samples underestimate it.

A shape that does not complete is recorded as **DNF** rather than crashing
the lane — see below for why that is a normal outcome here.

## What the first run found (2026-08-01, M4 MBP)

**Pythia has no compilation signal at all.** `f/s` is 1.0 or very near it for
every shape at every size — the whole table, both axes. That is the expected
result and it is worth having on the record rather than assumed: CPython does
not specialise on closure types, so the type-nesting pathology that costs
Jurist 7.1 seconds on a 100-element `foldl` over a `List` costs Pythia
nothing. `fold-list` reads 1.0× at n=10, 25, 50 and 100.

That closes a stated limit of the Jurist finding
(`purescript-julia/docs/PERFORMANCE-FINDING-2026-08-01-type-nesting.md`),
which said "nothing was checked on Pythia or Gnomon" and noted that
confirming it would make the type-nesting result the family's first genuinely
runtime-specific performance finding. It is.

What Pythia *does* show is the cost of an interpreter with no tail calls:

- `loop-naive` runs about 3.4× the per-iteration cost of `loop-fore`. Slower,
  not catastrophic — the honest contrast with Jurist's three orders of
  magnitude, and the reason the guidance is "prefer a host loop" rather than
  "Effect recursion is broken".
- `loop-tailrec` is the most expensive loop shape here (rel ~28 at n=10000),
  because `MonadRec`'s trampoline is real allocation on every step.
- `ffi-array` is nearly free relative to everything else — `sum()` is C. The
  FFI axis is not only a cost on this runtime; it is sometimes the fast path.

**One thing the lane needs on CPython specifically.** The runner raises the
recursion limit to 200,000 before importing the corpus. Python has no tail
calls, so a PureScript function that recurses n deep recurses n deep in
Python; at the default limit of 1000, `loop-naive` would raise
`RecursionError` and be recorded as DNF — a result that says nothing about
performance.

**Why the schedule is ordered the way it is.** The pathological shapes run
last, so a lane that hits its timeout still delivers most of the table, and
the corpus flushes stdout after every line so that a timeout yields both the
completed measurements and the identity of the shape that hung. Both came from
Jurist's first run; they cost nothing here and the corpus is shared.
