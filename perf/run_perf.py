"""
The performance canary.

Builds the shared shape corpus once with `purs --codegen corefn,js`, generates
Python with purepy, runs the SAME harness on both backends, and compares the
result against a recorded baseline.

The question it answers is "has this backend drifted against ITSELF?" — not
"which runtime is faster". Cross-runtime numbers fall out and are printed,
but they are not the claim and must not become the framing: the shapes are
chosen to be attributable, not to be representative of real programs.

WHY THE BASELINE STORES RATIOS, NOT MILLISECONDS
------------------------------------------------
An absolute baseline is worthless the moment it leaves the machine that
recorded it — a laptop on battery, a busy CI runner and an M4 disagree by
more than any interesting regression. So each shape is normalised, within its
own backend and its own run, against a calibration shape (`loop-fore` at
n=1000). Machine speed cancels, and what remains is the shape's cost
*relative to a plain host loop on the same runtime* — which is exactly the
quantity that should not move when the code generator changes.

Two derived numbers are gated:

  rel  steady(shape) / steady(loop-fore@1000)   — cost relative to a host loop
  f/s  first / steady                           — how much of the first call
                                                  is compilation

`f/s` is the type-nesting signal in one number. It is ~1 on a runtime that
does not compile per call site and grows with n exactly where specialisation
is happening.

Checksums are compared across backends BEFORE any timing is looked at. A
benchmark that computes the wrong answer quickly is the classic way for a
performance suite to stay green while what it measures rots.

Usage:
    cd perf
    python3 run_perf.py                      # build + run + check
    python3 run_perf.py --skip-build
    python3 run_perf.py --backends js        # subset
    python3 run_perf.py --update-baseline    # re-record (say why in the commit)

# The calibration shape. Everything is expressed relative to this, per
# backend, per run. `loop-fore` is the right choice because it is the
# cheapest thing that still touches the whole representation — a host loop, a
# closure call and a Ref write per iteration — so it tracks general runtime
# speed without tracking any one shape's pathology.
#
# The SIZE matters as much as the shape, and n=1000 was the wrong one. At five
# reps that is six thousand iterations, which is not enough work for a tiering
# JIT to finish tiering: JS steady at n=1000 was measured at 114, 135, 167,
# 188 and 196 us on the same machine on the same day. A calibration that moves
# by 1.7x moves every ratio derived from it by 1.7x, so the noise floor of the
# whole lane was set by its own denominator. n=10000 is ten times the work and
# lands past the warm-up on every runtime measured. The tell that this was
# real: loop-fore@10000 read rel 10.4 on Jurist (linear in n, as a host loop
# should be) but 6.3 on JS — not because the JS loop is sublinear, but because
# its denominator was too slow.
CALIBRATION = ("loop-fore", 10000)

# How far a ratio may move before it is reported. This now has a measurement
# behind it rather than a guess: six back-to-back runs of all three backends
# on an idle M4 MBP, 2026-08-01. Over the GATED population (see below) the
# worst run-to-run spread was 1.69x, the 90th percentile 1.21x and the median
# 1.10x — so 2.0 leaves 1.18x of headroom over the worst thing noise did in
# six tries, and still catches any regression of 2x or more.
#
# The number did not need to change; the population did. Over ALL measured
# rows the worst spread was 5.74x, so a 2.0 gate applied to everything would
# have fired on noise more or less every run. That is the whole finding.
#
# Tighten toward the 90th percentile once a few weeks of CI runs say what the
# tail really looks like — six samples underestimate it.
TOLERANCE = 2.0

# Two filters decide whether a row is GATED (counts toward failure) or merely
# reported. Both express the same idea: a measurement has to carry information
# before it is allowed to fail a build.
#
#   1. Only the largest n of each shape. The smaller sizes are there to show
#      the CURVE — superlinearity, and f/s growing with n, which is the
#      type-nesting signal. A curve point is a diagnostic, not a threshold.
#   2. Only shapes whose steady time clears this floor. Below it, scheduler
#      noise and timer resolution dominate: `ffi-array@1600` on the JS
#      reference is ~20 us and swings 1.5x between runs while doing exactly
#      the same work.
#
# The floor is absolute because the things it guards against are absolute. It
# is therefore a property of the machine that RECORDED the baseline, and the
# decision travels with the baseline rather than being recomputed per run —
# otherwise a shape sitting near the line would gate on one run and not the
# next. On a slower machine this excludes rows that would have been
# measurable there, which loses a little coverage and never invents an alarm.
