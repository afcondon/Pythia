"""
The performance canary.

Builds the shared shape corpus once with `purs --codegen corefn,js`, generates
Python with purepy, runs the SAME harness on both backends, and compares the
result against a recorded baseline.

The question it answers is "has this backend drifted against ITSELF?" — not
"which runtime is faster". Cross-runtime numbers fall out and are printed,
but they are not the claim and must not become the framing: the shapes are
chosen to be attributable, not to be representative of real programs.

WHY THE BASELINE STORES RATIOS, NOT MILLISECONDS
------------------------------------------------
An absolute baseline is worthless the moment it leaves the machine that
recorded it — a laptop on battery, a busy CI runner and an M4 disagree by
more than any interesting regression. So each shape is normalised, within its
own backend and its own run, against a calibration shape (`loop-fore` at
n=1000). Machine speed cancels, and what remains is the shape's cost
*relative to a plain host loop on the same runtime* — which is exactly the
quantity that should not move when the code generator changes.

Two derived numbers are gated:

  rel  steady(shape) / steady(loop-fore@1000)   — cost relative to a host loop
  f/s  first / steady                           — how much of the first call
                                                  is compilation

`f/s` is the type-nesting signal in one number. It is ~1 on a runtime that
does not compile per call site and grows with n exactly where specialisation
is happening.

Checksums are compared across backends BEFORE any timing is looked at. A
benchmark that computes the wrong answer quickly is the classic way for a
performance suite to stay green while what it measures rots.

Usage:
    cd perf
    python3 run_perf.py                      # build + run + check
    python3 run_perf.py --skip-build
    python3 run_perf.py --backends js        # subset
    python3 run_perf.py --update-baseline    # re-record (say why in the commit)
    python3 run_perf.py --json out.json
